Here’s the deal folks- 


The days of stacking bonus bets for every home run in a game are gone, but Dinger Tuesday lives on—and it’s still one of the most fun ways to get in on the long ball action each week.


Throughout this 2025 season, FanDuel is giving out 50% profit boosts on any home run prop—elligible on one bet, every Tuesday. This works on both straight bets or parlays, so if you want to bump up your pay day on a single player, or you’re shooting for a lottery cash, you might as well take advantage of the extra lift. 


And that’s not all—DraftKings is also in on the fun, offering a no-sweat bet you can use on home run props. If your bet loses, you get your stake back in bonus bets. All to say there’s a few areas here we can look to exploit. 


Let’s caveat one time before we dive in: home runs are volatile. They’re long shots in nature. You’re not building a stable betting portfolio here—you’re chasing upside. However, these bets are fun. And in the end, some of this is meant to be about entertainment. It’s exciting to dive into the stats, handicap the matchups, the ballparks, the conditions, etc. It’s exhilarating when you find an angle, you play the angle and it hits. That’s kind of what sports betting is all about. 


So let’s dive into today’s slate. 


Time to find a guy. 


Let’s start off with some unbelievably great news. (Read: worst news you could get to start the day)


The weather report is not looking great. 


According to BallparkPal—a great handicapping tool for baseball bettors—we’ve got tough hitting conditions across much of the country today. I’m talking wind blowing in, low temps, and high barometric pressure (not great for carry). But one game stands out.


Baseball’s most notorious launching pad is showing ideal hitting conditions tonight: no wind, mild temps, low pressure, and just enough humidity to keep the ball going.


On the mound, at Coors Field, we’ve got Freddy Peralta vs. Kyle Freeland.


Peralta gave up 26 home runs last season, tied for 14th-most in MLB. Freeland allowed 22—but in just two-thirds the innings. That’s a whole lotta hard contact in a hitter’s park.


Conditions? ✅
Pitchers? ✅
Ballpark? ✅


This one’s got all the ingredients for a dinger or two (or five????).


Let’s break it down even more and find our angle.


First step- I like to analyze the splits. Are we looking for righties or lefties here? 


In 2024, Peralta gave up twice as many home runs to righties as he did to lefties. Also convenient enough, Peralta was much worse against batters the first time he faced them. Thirteen of his 26 long balls were given up to first time faced batters. Now what about Freeland?


Freeland gave up over 80% of his homers to righty batters. That’s a massive split. 


Let’s see what the odds are saying:


Our options in order (via FanDuel Odds)


1. Hunter Goodman +430
2. Michael Toglia +480
3. Ezequiel Tovar +500
4. Brenton Doyle +500
5. Ryan McMahon +600
6. Nick Martini +750
7. Kris Bryant +750
8. Zac Veen +750
9. Kyle Farmer +800
  

  

Hunter Goodman has been ice cold lately—just one hit in his last 16 plate appearances—but I think the day off is exactly what he needed. His underlying numbers still pop, especially his impressive barrel rate. 


And for an added bonus, Goodman has one at-bat vs. Peralta in his career which he blasted for a homer. Combine all that with favorable conditions at Coors and a juicy price at +430, and I’m more than willing to take a stab here. 


Brenton Doyle is another name worth considering. He just went deep the other night, so if you’re looking to ride the hot hand, this could be your guy. At +500, the value is definitely there.


Now on the other side. 


1. Rhys Hoskins +360
2. Jackson Chourio +430
3. Willy Contreras +440
4. Christian Yelich +520
5. Garett Mitchell +680
6. Joey Ortiz +750
7. Vinny Capra +750
8. Sal Frelick +1000
9. Brice Turange +1000


  

  

I have no idea how we’re going to get away from Jackson Chourio here. Hoskins has a better history against Freeland, going 4/11 vs Chourio’s 0/3, but with a price like +430 I really do love the situation.


I think +360 is a bit too low to play for Hoskins, but if we want to shoot for the stars, there’s only one player on the Brewers who has a homer against Freeland, and that’s Contreras. If you want to play the historical matchup, maybe take a flier on this one, though +440 feels a bit too gross. Ballpark Pal has his true odds at +550, and I would tend to agree. 


Let’s ride Goodman and Chourio tonight. I think I’ll take them both straight, and parlay them for some fun. 


Maybe we’ll find another creative play, in which case I’ll update this article with new angles. But for now those are the plays on this edition of Dinger Tuesday. 


Lastly, we’ll always end Dinger Tuesday with two things.

Dinger Tuesday - May 6th


Key Info:
1. Hold off on placing any dinger bets until starting lineups are confirmed. Major sportsbooks will grade your bet as action even if your player only gets a single pinch-hit appearance — and we want to avoid that headache.
2. This article will be posted before lineups are out, but it will be updated as lineups are confirmed and weather conditions develop.
Recap


What is Dinger Tuesday?
If this is your first Dinger Tuesday, here’s a quick recap: FanDuel offers 50% profit boosts on any home run prop—eligible on one bet, every Tuesday. This works on both straight bets or parlays. Additionally, DraftKings is featuring a “No Sweat Home Run Bet,” allowing you to place a home run prop wager with a safety net—if your bet loses, you receive a bonus bet refund.
Every Tuesday you can expect home run prop bet handicapping here at VSiN, analyzing weather conditions, ballpark factors, batter vs pitcher matchups, extended splits, and more. It’s a great way to have a little fun on some exciting long shot bets. Let’s dive in.
Weather and Ballpark Factors
It’s chaos at the dinger tuesday handicapping HQ this morning (DTHHQ) as we’re looking at potential rain outs in 7 of 12 outdoor ballparks. So here’s the deal. We’ll play this like a normal DT, but I may lean towards plays with a better shot of actually taking place tonight. Here we go…


To keep you in the loop, rain isn’t always a bad thing. 


^great movie 


But seriously. Here’s what our friends at Ballpark Pal said: This sort of forecast isn't all that bad for offense, though (as long as the games actually get played) as the high humidity and low pressure associated with storms helps the ball fly a bit farther.


So which parks are showing the best pop for today?
* Great American Ball Park (Cincinnati) – +37% HR boost
* Citizens Bank Park (Philadelphia) – +12% HR boost
* Progressive Field (Cleveland) – +10% HR boost


Let’s break it down.


Cincinnati is today’s headline. Great American Ball Park already leads the league as the #1 home run stadium in baseball over the last three years, and today it gets a boost from the weather. High humidity and low atmospheric pressure create prime carry conditions. Add in warm temps and a slight breeze out? Could be a launch pad tonight. 


Citizens Bank Park is another winner. Ranked #5 in home run factor over the past three seasons, it’s already friendly to power hitters. Toss in today’s humidity and soft air pressure, and it becomes a top-tier target. Ball should be flying in Philly.


Progressive Field, on the other hand, is tricky. Yes, we’re seeing a decent +10% bump in home run probability thanks to the same low-pressure, high-moisture cocktail — but this is still a pitcher-friendly park at its core. Even with the conditions on our side, I’m likely staying away unless a specific matchup pops. 


With weather creating some uncertainty in the boosted parks above, we may end up leaning on some of the classic power spots on the slate. Dodger Stadium — ranked #2 in home runs over the last three seasons — and Globe Life Field in Texas — sitting at #6 in that same span — are both looking solid tonight with stable conditions.


I’m eyeing a few strong matchups in those parks, and they’ll likely take center stage when it comes time for the official plays of the day.
Pitchers
The best pitchers to attack today can be found on this spreadsheet. 
José Berríos is your top look. He gave up 31 home runs last season, second-most in MLB, and he’s already allowed 8 this year. That puts him right on pace to stay in the top tier of dinger-friendly arms. 
Sonny Gray isn’t quite as obvious, but he’s quietly given up 6 home runs through 8 starts — and today, he’s pitching in Citizens Bank Park, one of the best parks for power. Combine that with a red-hot Phillies lineup and some humidity-induced carry, and this could be a sneaky-good spot to exploit.
Jonathan Cannon takes the mound for the White Sox. While his 6 home runs allowed over 8 starts might not raise alarms, his opponent Barrel% tells a different story. He’s getting squared up — and in a park like Great American Ball Park, with a 37% HR boost on deck, that’s a dangerous combo. As an added bonus, we have a dinger tuesday double dipper on our hands. The White Sox bullpen has allowed a league second most, 23 home runs this season. They lead the league in meatball pitch percentage as well. Big opportunities today in Cinci. 
Jeffrey Springs is another arm worth watching today. Anytime someone’s facing the Dodgers in LA, it’s worth a closer look — and Springs is on the bump tonight.
He’s given up 6 home runs through 8 starts, right in line with the trend we’ve seen across a few middling arms today. But here’s the kicker: two of those starts came against the White Sox, which makes the stat line look a bit softer than it probably should. Facing this Dodgers lineup is a different animal.
Digging into some of the batter vs. pitcher matchups, there are a few LA hitters with strong underlying metrics against Springs' pitch mix. This feels like a sneaky-good spot to grab some value on Dodgers bats with legit pop.
Kyle Freeland takes the mound for the Rockies tonight with an 0-5 record and a bloated 6.41 ERA. While he’s only allowed 3 home runs so far this season, don’t let that fool you — his average exit velocity and Hard Hit% are among the worst on the slate. His HR rate was significantly higher last year, and all signs point to regression incoming. He’s overdue to get tagged.
One last note: if you’re digging into Guardians vs Brewers, be aware of Logan Allen. His 5.09% home run rate is the worst on the board today. His surface stats in 2025 have improved, but in a game with a slight HR boost, the numbers say regression could hit. I’m likely passing, but if you're hunting for a contrarian edge, this is a data-backed angle to consider.
Batters
After analyzing all the factors on board. I’m attacking the following teams:
Reds:
There are a few intriguing options in this Reds lineup, but the most obvious one has to be Elly De La Cruz.


Elly continues to flash elite exit velocity and hard-hit rates, consistently ranking among the top percentile in both categories. He’s far more comfortable against right-handed pitching, and tonight’s matchup lines up perfectly — facing Jonathan Cannon, whose Barrel% and HR/PA suggest he’s highly vulnerable, especially in a power-friendly setting.


Add in the hitter-friendly conditions at Great American Ball Park — currently showing a +37% HR boost — and this feels like a prime spot for Elly to get back on track and do some serious damage. All signs point to a bounce-back performance.
Dodgers
I’m leaning into the historical matchup here. Kiké (Enrique) Hernández is 4-for-9 lifetime against Jeffrey Springs with a home run already on the ledger — and the profile suggests he could add another tonight.
According to BallparkPal, Kiké holds an A- grade vs. left-handed four-seamers, which just so happens to make up 43% of Springs’ pitch mix. That’s a green light against a pitch he sees well, from a guy he’s already taken deep.
To top it off, he’s in form — hitting .353 with a .588 slugging percentage over the last 7 days. Strong matchup, hot bat, proven track record… this feels like a prime opportunity to cash in.
Rangers
The Rangers recently recalled Jake Burger from Triple-A after a sluggish start to the season — but don’t let the early struggles fool you. This is a guy with serious power upside, having hit 23 home runs last year and 28 the season before.
Burger’s got the kind of raw strength that can change a game with one swing, and tonight’s matchup gives him a real shot to remind everyone why he’s a threat at the plate. He’s facing a pitcher whose arsenal lines up perfectly with what Burger likes to see — especially when you dive into his success against certain pitch types.
If you’re hunting for a sneaky dinger play with big-time upside, Burger’s a name to circle.
